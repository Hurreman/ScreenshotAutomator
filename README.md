# ScreenshotAutomator
Automatically take screenshots of a webpage/URL once when it changes. The purpose is to have a timeline of how a project changes, and later merge these screenshtos into an animated gif or movie to visualize change over time.

Uses node-webshot (https://github.com/brenden/node-webshot) for screenshots, and currently only checks if the filesize of the screenshot has changed.
Might use resembles.js or similar to acutally compare the screenshots, havn't decided yet.
